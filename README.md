Sirat Art Gallery App

Sirat Art Gallery is a single page application with a Ruby on Rails backend and a JavaScript frontend. Currently, it allows art pieces to be uploaded, with information about the art and the name of the artist. I would like to build it out to include a link to video tutorials of the artwork. My goal is to eventually allow users to select art pieces to include in a collection to create a personalized art course for themselves. This project requires Ruby version 2.6.1 and Ruby Gems. The links to the application front and backends are:
